  <h2>WEB</h2>
<P>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="HTML5" > Markup Language (HTML)</a>is the standard markup language used for <strong><u>web pages</u> and web applications.</strong>
Alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS), it forms the triad of the World Wide Web (WWW).
A web browser would typically receive HTML documents from either a web server or local storage. 
These documents are then rendered into multimedia web pages by the browser for viewing by a user and as such; one can say that these documents basically make up the structure of a web page semantically and originally, cues for the appearance of the document.

<p>
Through the use of HTML elements, a web page can consist of various different entities ranging from images to interactive web forms. 
This is accomplished by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and etc. 
These elements are identified by tags; angled brackets surrounding the keyword.
For example, tags such as img and input are used to display content on the page while other tags such as p...psurrounded text but no tags are ever actually displayed by the browser as they're only used to interpret the page's contents.

It should be noted that HTML can go a step further and allow developers to embed scripts into it such as JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets to further manipulate and define how the content appears.
